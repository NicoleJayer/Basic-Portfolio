  <p>Hello there, my name is Nicole and this is my online portfolio. I am a recent graduate of
  James Madison University with a double major in Communications Studies and Media Arts & Design.
  After some time working for a non-profit in Washington, D.C. I decided my passion was not
  in communications, but in software development.</p>
  <p>I enrolled in the GW Coding Bootcamp and began my journey into the world of software development
  in May 2018. I look forward to enhancing my skills as a developer and expanding on my professional career.
  Check out my porfolio for a collection of my in-class and personal projects.</p>
