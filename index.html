  <p>Hey there, my name is Nicole and I am a 22 year-old taking her first steps into the world of web and software development. I graduated from James Madison University in May 2017 with a double major in Commuications and Media Arts & Design. After time spent working for a non-profit in Washington, D.C. I discovered that my passions did not lie in the filed of communications but rather in web development and design.</p>
  <p>I had always dabbled in web development from a young age, but decided now was the time to persue it on a professional level. Though one can achieve success through self-teaching and great discipline, I decided a more formal class structure would be the best way to further educate myself. I enrolled in the GW Coding Bootcamp and began classes May 2018. I have come full-cirlce in my education, and now more than ever before, have a clearer picture of what I want my future to look like.</p>
  <p>I plan to work towards learning full-stack web development via the GW Bootcamp curriculum, and then after graduating the program, working to find a relevant career in the city of my dreams, Seattle, Washington.</p>
